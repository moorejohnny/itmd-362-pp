I removed the entire “My Organizations” module and replaced it with a more needed, “Upcoming Assignments” module. The HTML would be similar to the previous module, you just need to change the labels and contents. The CSS should style it like the others with no problems. You can link to where the assignments are located from the module. I do not believe any JavaScript would be necessary to complete this change.
