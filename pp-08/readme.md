# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-08/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: It is very sleek and futuristic. It has a minimal design with no extra appendages. Everything in very contained. It makes me feel sanitary, and I should clean everything that will be around it.

* Behavioral: It's easy to tell it's a laptop at first glance. It functions very well for a laptop. The aluminum case on the laptop is satisfying to touch.

* Reflective: This laptop is more on the aesthetic side of laptops. I think apple wanted it to look professional from first glance. 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Keep a sleek and clean design. Don't make it too convoluted.
2. Keep it simple. Only have what you need.
3. Make it pretty so it is more approachable for a wider audience.
